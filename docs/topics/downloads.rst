Welcome to the Salt download page!

* Salt packages are hosted on `repo.saltproject.io <https://repo.saltproject.io/>`_.
* For unsupported versions:

  * PY3 packages are in the `archive repository <https://archive.repo.saltproject.io/>`_
    under the ``py3`` and ``salt/py3`` directories.
  * PY2 packages are in the `archive repository <https://archive.repo.saltproject.io/>`__
    under the ``yum`` and ``apt`` directories. Other PY2 packages may be found
    under their respective directories, such as ``osx``, ``windows``,
    ``freebsd``, and so forth.


The following sections provide links to the repository for each operating
system as well as links to the installation instructions for each operating
system.

.. Tip::
    As a security best practice, always verify that you have downloaded Salt
    from the authorized site by comparing the SHA/MD5 of the package or by
    verifying the package URL is an official Salt repository.
