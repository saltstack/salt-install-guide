Install Salt on Photon OS 5
===========================
To install Salt on Photon OS 5:

#. Run the following commands to install the Salt Project repository and key:

   **Click the tab for the Salt version you would like to pin for updates:**

   .. tab-set::

       .. tab-item:: Photon OS 5 (Latest onedir)

           To pin your Salt upgrades to the :ref:`latest` :ref:`onedir` package
           of Salt for **Photon OS 5**:

           .. parsed-literal::

               sudo rpm --import \ |photonos5-latest-gpg|\

               curl -fsSL \ |photonos5-latest-download|\  | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/salt.repo

               tdnf clean all

   salt-master, or other Salt components:

   **Click the tab for the Salt version you would like to pin for updates:**

   .. tab-set::

       .. tab-item:: Photon OS 5 (Latest)

           To install the latest release of Salt packages that are available in
           the Photon OS repository, run these commands:

           .. code-block:: bash

               sudo tdnf install salt-master
               sudo tdnf install salt-minion
               sudo tdnf install salt-ssh
               sudo tdnf install salt-syndic
               sudo tdnf install salt-cloud
               sudo tdnf install salt-api


       .. tab-item:: Photon OS 5 (Specific releases)

           The following is an example of how to install a specific release of
           Salt based on the list of packages available in the Photon OS
           repository:

           .. code-block:: bash

               sudo tdnf install salt3-master-3005-1.ph5

           .. Note::
               The file extensions are based on which version of Photon OS you
               are installing Salt services on. For example, the extension for
               Photon OS 3 is ``.ph3`` and the extension for Photon OS 4 is
               ``.ph4``.


#. Enable and start the services for salt-minion, salt-master, or other Salt
   components:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo systemctl enable salt-master && sudo systemctl start salt-master
       sudo systemctl enable salt-minion && sudo systemctl start salt-minion
       sudo systemctl enable salt-syndic && sudo systemctl start salt-syndic
